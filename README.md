# Audio eCommerce Website

This project was designed by a Frontend Mentor in Figma and developed by me. To create this website, I used React with TypeScript. To style the app, I used TailwindCSS and Framer-Motion for animations. This project contains static data for headphones, speakers, and earphones. You have the possibility to add and delete products from the cart, but also you can finalize the order after completing your delivery details.
